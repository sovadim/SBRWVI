# Hardware tests

Hardware tests are designed to test both independent modules and components of the robot and the robot as a whole.
All tests are evaluated visually on a working robot.

The `Independent` folder is intended to test individual independent components, such as the engine, MPU, and others.

The `sbrwvi` folder is intended for testing assembled robot components, such as the chassis and others
